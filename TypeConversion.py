#converting a data type to a different is known as type casting.
# Example    
a = '100'
b = type(int(a))
print(b)
#another way of writing the same thing would look like this:
Type = type(int(str(100)))
print(Type)
#Both the results are going to print the same output but, the 1st method declares different variables to help us understand the process of casting in the structural way.
